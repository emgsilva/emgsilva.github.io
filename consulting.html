  <p>I have some availability to do small consulting activities in the following two topics:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#sociotechnical-architecture">Sociotechnical Architecture Assessment & Consulting</a></li>
      <li><a href="#tech-leadership">Tech Leadership Coaching, Mentoring and Advising</a></li>
    </ul>
    
   Feel free to <a href="https://esilva.net/about#contacts">contact me</a> if you think we should collaborate. I also have a series to Talks (on both of the topics) that I can give for company events (can be done with extended Q&A) or as keynote on events, you can find more details in my <a href="https://esilva.net/talks">Talks</a> page</p>

   <img src="/assets/sociotechnical-evolution-loop.png" width="350px" align="right" hspace="10px">
   <p>I have been working and researching on the topic of Sociotehcnical Architecture and pioneering ideas and mechanisms to introduce it and implement it in modern tech-enabled organizations, especially on Product-led organizations. I have applied and validated them in different types of organizations and frequently write <a href="https://esilva.net/sociotechnical">articles</a> and give <a href="https://esilva.net/talks">talks</a> on this topic.</p>

     <summary><b>Sociotechnical Architecture</b> (click for more details)</summary>
     <p>What is "Sociotechnical Architecture"? My definition: "Sociotechnical Architecture is about taking an holistic co-design approach to technical and organizational systems, given the inherent impact they have on each other." To me this is the next level of evolution for approaching the building and evolution of tech-enabled products, i.e.: stop working in partial optimizations (and silos) and start building and evolving the teams (all disciplines needed, not just tech disciplines) and technical architectures of the products they build with an aligned understanding. Important: this is a continuous activity, i.e.: you need to create operating models that embrace and thrive on that (this is not a project that finishes after one year). Furthermore, this is not meant as "big up-front holistic design", but on creating feedback loop mechanisms for capturing holistic understanding and enable that to empower small, effective and autonomous product teams.</p>

    <a name="tech-leadership"></a><h2>Tech Leadership Mentoring, Coaching and Advising</h2>
    
    <img src="/assets/engineering-strategy.png" width="350px" align="right" hspace="10px">
    <p>I have been working as Tech Lead & Software Engineer/Architect for over a decade, from leading teams to leading groups of Tech Leads and also evolving tech organizations. I see tech leadership as one of the most important skills to modernize tech-enabled organizations and evolve them into high-performing, where tech is an enabler of product development and evolution and not just a "cost centre". Check my <a href="https://esilva.net/articles">writings</a> and <a href="https://esilva.net/tla_insights/#tech-leadership">research</a> on this topic.</p>

    <b>Typical Activities:</b>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Coach and/or Mentoring First Time Tech Leads / Software Architects</u> - one-on-ones, or workshops for groups of tech leads, to help on the transition from being an engineer to be a tech lead (or multiplier as Pat Kua says).</li>
      <li><u>Advising Tech Leaders / VPs Engineering / CTOs</u> - especially on defining and operating tech strategy, high-performing engineering culture and tech orgs operations models (for product-led organizations).</li>
    </ul>
