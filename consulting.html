    <p>What is "Sociotechnical Architecture"? My definition: "Sociotechnical Architecture is about taking an holistic co-design approach to technical and organizational systems, given the inherent impact they have on each other." To me this is the next level of evolution for how we approach building tech-enabled products, i.e.: stop working in partial optimizations and start building and evolving the teams and technical architectures of the products they build with an aligned understanding. Important: this is a continuous activity, i.e.: you need to create operating models that embrace and thrive on that (this is not a project that finishes after one year).</p>

    <p>For more details on my work check my <a href="https://esilva.net/sociotechnical">Sociotechnical Architecture and Systems</a> page and my <a href="https://esilva.net/talks">talks page</a>, as I regularly write and talk on this subject.</p>
