<h2>What is Sociotechnical Architecture?</h2>
<p><it>Sociotechnical Architecture is about taking an holistic co-design approach to technical and organizational systems, given the inherent impact they have on each other.</it> </p>

<p>In other words (from Nick Tune): <it>When we are architecting a software system, we must consider the impact on the teams in the organisation and vice-versa.</it></p>
