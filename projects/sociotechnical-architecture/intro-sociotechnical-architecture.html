  <p>This page contains a series of articles that discuss several elements relevant to Sociotechnical Architecture. The
    goal is to create a good introduction to Sociotechnical Architecture so that it can be more widely used when
    architecting and setting up strategies to build our software products.</p>

  <h2>What is Sociotechnical Architecture?</h2>

    <i>Sociotechnical Architecture is about taking an holistic co-design approach to technical and organizational
      systems, given the inherent impact they have on each other.</i>
  </p>

  <p>In other words (from Nick Tune): <i>When we are architecting a software system, we must consider the impact on the
      teams in the organisation and vice-versa.</i>
