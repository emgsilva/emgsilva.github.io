Welcome to the digest #1 of my "Technical Leadership and Architecture insights" (or TLA_insights for short).

![light](/assets/tla_insights-text.png)

**What isÂ this?** TLA_insights is compilation of insights (![light](/assets/light-bulb.png) "*deeper understanding*") I develop in the topics of Technical Leadership and Architecture (in context of Building Software products). This is a rather broad area, which means one needs to develop all sorts of skills and knowledge to be able to "develop & make things better". To accomplish this I tend to study different resources, from which I take notes to distill the most interesting insights. With TLA_insights I want to curate those insights further and give some of my own views and interpretations. Hopefully these curated insights are useful for other people interested in these topics.

> I will be publishing a digest of TLA_insights at least once a month. This also may look like a newsletter, but it really is about sharing curated insights, which may not be "news" all the time, so I am calling it an "Insights-letter".

**Why am I doing this?** Two reasons:

- 1: curate and consolidate the insights I develop, as I will further process and organize them in my mind while writing them down, and with that I improve my knowledge and command of these topics
- 2: to share these insights with others, who can also benefit from that

**How is this organized?** It is basically a collection of summaries & insights from resources I find interesting. I will be organizing these into sections, which represent areas I am really interested and actively developing/researching in the wider topic of Technical Leadership and Architecture. Currently these are the areas:

- [Sociotechnical Architecture & Systems Design](#sociotech)
- [Technical Leadership](#tech-leadership)
- [Software {Architecture, Engineering & Tech}](#software)
- [Personal Productivity](#productivity)

I hope you have fun and find some interesting insights here. Don't hesitate to [contact](mailto:emgsilva@gmail.com) me if you have questions or want to chat about these topics.
