<p>My name is Eduardo da Silva. I am a senior software engineer/architect/tech-lead with a solid academic background (PhD in Computer Science) and hands-on experience on designing and building software products. I am a positive person and team player/builder with a sharp eye on continuous learning/experimentation - believe these are the key ingredients to build great/scalable things.</p> 

<p>Since 2005 I have been doing different things: university researcher and teacher; consultant; trainer; tech lead; engineer and architect of software products. I have also been founder, CEO and lead engineer of a startup company (created from the results of my PhD thesis).</p>

<p>Currently I am working on tech lead and software architecture roles, empowering multiple teams on maximizing their impact. This involves hands-on technical design, research, architecture and development. However, it also/especially entails a lot of work with teams/people, building the necessary technical community and platform for them to scale. I am doing this on the context of teams building data science empowered products (not only teams with data scientists, but the full stack required to build a product: data, backend, front-end, experimentation, etc).</p> 

<p>On my free time I love to play futsal (though have not played so much lately...), watch good movies and read.</p>
