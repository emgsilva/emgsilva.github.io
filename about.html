<p>My name is Eduardo da Silva and I am Portuguese. I am a senior software engineer/architect/tech-lead with a solid academic background (PhD in Computer Science) and hands-on experience on designing and building software products. I am a team player/builder with a keen eye on continuous learning/experimentation, so that I can design and build products as best as possible (= striving for excellence while keeping a sharp pragmatic eye on results).</p>

<p>Since 2005 I have lived in Sweden, Switzerland and Netherlands - where I currently live, on the beautiful Amsterdam. During these years I have done different things: university researcher and teacher, consultant, trainer, developer and architect of software systems. I have also been founder and lead engineer of a startup company.</p>

On my free time I love to play futsal (though have not played so much lately...), watch good movies and read.
