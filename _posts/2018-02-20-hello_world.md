```scala
print("Hello World! I am back!")
```

After a few years of "downtime" (and many changes...), I am reviving [esilva.net](http://esilva.net): my website and blog.

My goal with esilva.net is to publish/share interesting things things I come across or do. Mostly, these publications will be related with my day-to-day professional activities - note: these will always be my own opinions, not the ones from my employer. Why am I doing this? Because I am a long time note writer (love to document things I read, learn, observe, build, etc. However, those notes tend to "get lost" or be only useful for myself. I believe that is a shame, as that knowledge can be useful to myself (as a reference and also as I write things down I further comprehend and organize those notes) and also to others that may be facing the same challenges or are interested on similar topics.

See you soon!
