title:  "DDD EU 2021 Conference - Short Summary"
categories: [conference, ddd]

This week I was at [DDD EU 2021 conference](https://dddeurope.com/2021/). This time was online, but still was a great conference, filled with learnings, a great energy and a "sense of community", which consolidates that this is a conference I will be returning to every year!

The conference was extremely well organized (kudos to organizers): mostly based on "hands-on workshops", but had this amazing notion of "open spaces", where basically anyone could propose a topic on a sort of "marketplace", which would be added to the "agenda" and anyone could just join. This created an extremely dynamic conference: there were certain things arranged before the conference, but then a lot of things were planned "on the fly", many based on discussions from some talks, or outcomes of workshops, or simply problems some people had and were looking for input from the community. Really great way to make this a vibrant conference!

I was on a few open spaces, and one of the workshops: "QualityStorming" with [Michael Plod](https://twitter.com/bitboss) ([https://speakerdeck.com/mploed/quality-storming](https://speakerdeck.com/mploed/quality-storming)). Extremely interesting workshop on how to adopt the proven "storming" (visual collaboration) techniques to "architecture qualities" (or "non-functional requirements"). Michael is always very good at this sort of workshops and this one was no exception: in two hours we went through a "near real experience" and I have to say I learned a lot and will for sure use this technique in the future. Highly recommended.

This time I also had the opportunity to give a "lighting talk" this year titled: "Sociotechnical Architecture as Enabler of Product Thinking". This talk sort of develops some of the ideas I have been exploring on Sociotechnical (& Systems) Thinking and Architecture ([https://esilva.net/sociotechnical](https://esilva.net/sociotechnical)) and how they relate with the Product Thinking. I had a lot of fun preparing this and presenting it. It also triggered very interesting discussions - this is definitely a topic that we don't yet have well developed and needs some further work. I will be working further on this topic, and see some other people also growing into this area, which is exciting. You can find the presentation bellow (more detailed blog post will follow).

I will be looking forward to 2022! Hopefully we will all be back in person to my Amsterdam! I however think with the success of this remote event we may be having many other interactions on conferences, let's see how this develops.
