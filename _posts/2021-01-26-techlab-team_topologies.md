Another conversation on bol.com's TechLab podcast on the book [Team Topologies](https://esilva.net/articles/review-team_topologies).

This was a lot of fun going into the details of the book and why this book provides a lot of value to organizations by (as I said during the interview): "a DSL (Domain Specific Language) for organization design and evolution".

We went over the details of the books (the types of teams, the types of interactions and how to evolve organizations with them) and also shared many of the examples of how we are using Team Topologies in the company (even sometimes without explicitly knowing it).
